# Apache-Spark-for-Data-Scientists
Code base for Spark training prepared and lectured by David Vrba

## Training Description:
This training is oriented on three main areas of data analytics. The first one is interactive data analytics with the DataFrame API where we will also see how Spark is integrated with popular Python library Pandas. The second area is machine learning with native library ML Pipelines where we will take a look how to train ml models and create ml prototypes. And the next topic is deep learning and Spark integration with other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Training Format
* 1-day if users have already some familiarity with Spark
* 2-days if users are completely new to Spark
* 50% theory, 50% hands on
* Language: Python

## Objectives of the training
* Learn how to analyze data using Spark
* Learn how to train ML models and create ML prototypes in Spark
* Integrate Spark with other data science technologies such as Pandas, SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras
