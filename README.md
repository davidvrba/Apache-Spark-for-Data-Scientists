# Apache-Spark-for-Data-Scientists
Code base for Spark training prepared and lectured by David Vrba

## Training Description:
This training is oriented on four main areas of data analytics. The first one is interactive data analytics with the DataFrame API where we will also see how Spark is integrated with popular Python library Pandas. The second area is machine learning with native library ML Pipelines where we will take a look how to train ml models and create ml prototypes. The next topic is deep learning and Spark integration with other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. And the last area is graph processing with the library GraphFrames.
